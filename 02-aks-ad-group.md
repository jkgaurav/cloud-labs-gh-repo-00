### **: Creating an Azure Active Directory Group for AKS Administrators via Azure Portal**

---

#### **Objective:**
The purpose of this document is to explain how to create an **Azure Active Directory (AD) Group** using the Azure Portal and its relevance for managing **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. The members of this AD group will later be given access to the AKS cluster to manage the cluster via `kubectl`.

---

### **1. Creating an Azure AD Group**

#### **Why Create an Azure AD Group?**

An **Azure AD Group** allows you to centralize access management by grouping users together who require similar permissions. Instead of managing permissions on a per-user basis, you can assign permissions to the group, and all members inherit those permissions. This is especially useful for scenarios like administering an AKS cluster, where multiple users need the same level of access.

#### **Steps to Create an Azure AD Group in the Portal:**

1. **Log in to the Azure Portal**:
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   - Sign in with your Azure account that has sufficient permissions (such as a Global Administrator or User Administrator role).

2. **Navigate to Azure Active Directory**:
   - In the left-hand navigation panel, select **Azure Active Directory**.

3. **Select 'Groups'**:
   - In the **Manage** section of Azure AD, click on **Groups**.

4. **Click ‘New Group’**:
   - At the top of the **Groups** blade, click on **+ New group**.

5. **Configure the Group**:
   - **Group type**: Select **Microsoft 365** as the group type. This will enable additional collaboration features like email and shared resources.
   - **Group Name**: Enter the group name, such as `"cloud-labs-aksgroup"`. The display name will appear in Azure AD.
   - **Group Description**: (Optional) Add a description like `"This group is only for testing"` to explain the group's purpose.
   - **Mail Nickname**: Enter a unique alias, such as `"cloud-labs-aksgroup"`. This nickname forms the email alias of the group (e.g., `cloud-labs-aksgroup@yourdomain.com`), even if you don’t plan to use it for email.
   - **Membership Type**: Choose **Assigned**. This means you will manually assign members to the group.

6. **Click ‘Create’**:
   - After filling out the required fields, click the **Create** button. The group will now be created and listed in Azure AD.

### **2. Managing Group Members**

After creating the Azure AD Group, the next step is to assign users as **members** and **owners**. The **owner** manages group membership and settings, while **members** are the users who need the permissions the group will later be granted.

#### **Steps to Add Yourself as an Owner and Member:**

1. **Navigate to the Group**:
   - From the Azure Portal, return to **Azure Active Directory** → **Groups**, and select the group you just created (e.g., `"cloud-labs-aksgroup"`).

2. **Add Owners**:
   - Under the **Manage** section, select **Owners**.
   - Click **+ Add owners**, search for your user account (or any others), and select it.
   - This will make you an owner of the group, giving you control over group settings and membership.

3. **Add Members**:
   - Under the **Manage** section, select **Members**.
   - Click **+ Add members**, search for your user account (or other users), and add them.
   - This step is crucial because only the members of the group will inherit the permissions that you will later assign to the group.

### **3. Key Concepts Explained**

#### **Group Type: Microsoft 365**
   - **Microsoft 365 Groups** allow collaboration features such as email, shared calendars, SharePoint access, and Microsoft Teams workspaces. Though you're creating this group primarily for AKS RBAC, Microsoft 365 is often used for collaborative scenarios. This is different from **Security Groups**, which are used primarily for managing access to resources without collaboration features.
   
   - Even though you're not leveraging the collaboration features now, Microsoft 365 Groups give you flexibility if you choose to integrate these capabilities later.

#### **Mail Nickname**
   - The **mail nickname** is an alias used for group email addresses. While the group you created is primarily for **AKS RBAC**, the mail nickname is still a required and unique identifier for all groups in Azure AD. This nickname becomes part of the group's email address (e.g., `cloud-labs-aksgroup@yourdomain.com`).

#### **Membership Type: Assigned**
   - When creating the group, you set the **Membership Type** to **Assigned**. This means you manually control who is part of the group. You could also choose **Dynamic Membership** to automatically add members based on rules (e.g., department, location), but for this case, **Assigned** membership works best since you want direct control over who can access the AKS cluster.

#### **Owners vs. Members**
   - **Owners**: Users assigned as owners can manage the group’s membership and settings. In this case, you added yourself as an owner to have full control over the group.
   - **Members**: These are the users who will inherit the permissions granted to the group. For AKS, once RBAC is applied, all members will be able to manage the cluster.

### **4. Purpose of the Group for AKS Administration**

The primary reason for creating this group is to manage **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) RBAC**. The Azure AD group will later be assigned to a **ClusterRoleBinding** within AKS, allowing group members to execute `kubectl` commands based on the permissions granted (e.g., `cluster-admin`).

- **Centralized Access Control**: By creating this Azure AD group, you simplify the process of granting and revoking AKS access. Instead of configuring permissions for each individual user, you add or remove users from the group, and they automatically inherit or lose access to the AKS cluster.
  
- **Security and Governance**: Using an Azure AD group for managing access aligns with **best practices for security**. It provides a centralized point to monitor and manage access, which is important for governance and auditing.

---

### **Conclusion**

You have successfully created an Azure AD group named `"cloud-labs-aksgroup"` using the Azure Portal. This group is configured as a **Microsoft 365 Group** with a **mail nickname** and **assigned membership**. You’ve added yourself as both an **owner** and a **member**, setting the foundation for using this group in AKS RBAC for managing access to the cluster via `kubectl`.

### **Next Steps**:
In the following steps, you will bind this group to the appropriate Kubernetes roles within the AKS cluster, allowing members of the group to manage and interact with the cluster.
